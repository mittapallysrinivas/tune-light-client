This guide walks you through the process of creating an application that consumes a
RESTful web service.

== What You Will Build

== Starting with Spring Initializr

For all Spring applications, you should start with the https://start.spring.io[Spring
Initializr]. The Initializr offers a fast way to pull in all the dependencies you need for
an application and does a lot of the set up for you. Because this example needs to be
nothing more than a web application, you need to include only the Web dependency. The
following image shows the Initializr set up for this sample project:

The following listing shows the `pom.xml` file created when you choose Maven:

These build files can be this simple because `spring-boot-starter-web` includes everything
you need to build a web application, including the Jackson classes you need to work with
JSON.

== Fetching a REST Resource

With project setup complete, you can create a simple application that consumes a RESTful
service.

A RESTful service has been stood up at https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=jack+johnson
It randomly fetches quotations about Spring Boot and returns them as JSON documents.

If you request that URL through your a web browser or curl, you receive a JSON document
that looks something like this:

====
[source,java,tabsize=2script]
----
{"wrapperType":"track",
 "kind":"song",
 "artistId":909253,
 "collectionId":120954021,

That is easy enough but not terribly useful when fetched through a browser or through curl.

A more useful way to consume a REST web service is programmatically. To help you with that
task, Spring provides a convenient template class called {RestTemplate}[`RestTemplate`].
`RestTemplate` makes interacting with most RESTful services a one-line incantation. And it
can even bind that data to custom domain types.

First, you need to create a entities classes to contain the data that you need. The following
listing shows the `Quote` class, which you can use as your domain class:

`src/main/java/com/cgi/itune/ITunesCollection.java`
'src/main/java/com/cgi/itune/ITuneResponse.java'


This simple Java class has a handful of properties and matching
getter methods. It is annotated with `@JsonIgnoreProperties` from the Jackson JSON
processing library to indicate that any properties not bound in this type should be ignored.

To directly bind your data to your custom types, you need to specify the
variable name to be exactly the same as the key in the JSON document returned from the API.
In case your variable name and key in JSON doc do not match, you can use `@JsonProperty`
annotation to specify the exact key of the JSON document. (This example matches each
variable name to a JSON key, so do not need that annotation here.)



This uses the same annotations but maps onto other data fields.

== Finishing the Application

The Initalizr creates a class with a `main()` method. The following listing shows the
class the Initializr creates (at
`src/main/jjava/com/cgi/itune/ITuneRestClientApplication.java`):

====
[src,Java]
----
include::initial/src/main/java/com/cgi/itune//ITuneRestClientApplication.java[]
----
====

Now you need to add a few other things to the `ITuneRestClientApplication` class to get it to
show quotations from our RESTful source. You need to add:

* A logger, to send output to the log (the console, in this example).
* A `RestTemplate`, which uses the Jackson JSON processing library to process the incoming
data.
* A `CommandLineRunner` that runs the `RestTemplate` (and, consequently, fetches our
quotation) on startup.

The following listing shows the finished `ITuneRestClientApplication` class (at
`complete\src\main\java\com\cgi\itune/ITuneRestClientApplication.java`):

====
[src,Java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/com/cgi/itune/ITuneRestClientApplication.java[]

== Running the Application

java -jar itune-rest-client-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar "Jim Jones"
